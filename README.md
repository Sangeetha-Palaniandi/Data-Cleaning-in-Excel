Project Description:
Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, incomplete, duplicate, corrupted, incorrectly structured, or otherwise erroneous data in a data set. These issues can arise from human error during data entry, merging different data structures, or combining different datasets that might use different terminology.
